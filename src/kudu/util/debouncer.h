/**
 * A debouncer is something that collates extra calls into a single call.
 *
 * Essentially, a debouncer allows a single (executing) entity to obtain a lock,
 * and a single additional (waiting) entity to wait for the lock. Additional
 * waiters (duplicates) will be rejected.
 *
 * This debouncer can thus be used to guarantee that one round of execution
 * always occurs after the some signal, but prevents duplicate execution from
 * multiple signals in a short time.
 *
 * This class can be templated with a mutex type which the executing entity will
 * hold and the waiting entity will block on. Duplicates are rejected based on a
 * atomic state flag.
 *
 * Note that this function satisfies the C++ Lockable requirement from a API
 * perspective only. It provides a try_lock function, but try_lock just attempts
 * to become the waiting entity, and will block while waiting to be the
 * executing entity. The original Lockable contract asserts that try_lock is
 * non-blocking, but that's not true here.
 *
 * As such, we can use it with RAII holders like std::scoped_lock, but blocking
 * vs non-blocking behaviour may be different.
